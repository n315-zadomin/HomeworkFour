For this assignment, we focused on User Feedback. We were to create alerts for when a user attempts to log into a site. For this assignment, I wanted to make it as realistic as possible. So, I decided to create a grooming salon page with a login portion. Overall I enjoy how the page turned out, and I had a lot of fun with the user feedback portion. I think this week the only thing I struggled with was responsiveness. It worked when I did it in lecture, but when I tried it did not work. I need to look back into this concept again.
